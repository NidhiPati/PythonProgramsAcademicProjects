# Python Programs - Academic Projects

* TrekWars:
  * Created some classes for the game. Used Inheritance concept
  * Created unit tests for 100 percent code coverage - 5 unit test files for the 5 classes
 
* Checkers:
  * Created small part of the game. Used Recursion concept
  * Given the position on the board, program computes the maximum number of jumps of one specific king checker in one turn
 
* Trains-Planes:
  * Items are unloaded from ships and are awaiting for trains and planes for transportation. Used Stacks and Queues concept
  * Items destined for trains are placed in a STACK until it reaches 5 items high, then a new stack is begun behind the original. Items destined for planes are placed on a long assembly line (there is only 1 assembly line - QUEUE). 
  * Given the order that items are unloaded from the ship, program determines the total time it will take to load all the materials to trains and planes
